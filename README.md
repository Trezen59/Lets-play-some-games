Entertainment purpose

I have made 3 games here.
1. snake game. 🐍
2. space shooter game. 🚀
3. tank game. 🚜

How to play these games? ▶️
  - It's really easy, you'll find the ready to execute game binaries in each game folder (try not to read the binary file 😂).
  - To play the games you will have to execute them in a terminal (Yes, you will require Linux termimal). 🐧
  - To execute them, run them as: "$ ./bin/snake_game"

Tell me your high score to taste a defeat. 🙆‍♂️

Have Fun! 🤩
